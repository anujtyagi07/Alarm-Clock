Description: This project is a repository for an Alarm Clock developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It aims to provide a soothing user experience with powerful features and a clean interface.

Problem Statement: The task is to create an alarm clock using only vanilla JavaScript, without utilizing any libraries or frameworks for JavaScript. However, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are permitted for styling purposes.

Required Features:

1. Clock Face:
   - Display a clock showing the current time where seconds, minutes, and hours change dynamically as time progresses.

2. Set Alarm:
   - Allow users to input the desired alarm time (hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM).
   - Once the user sets the alarm time and clicks the "Set Alarm" button, add the alarm to the list below.

3. Alarms List:
   - Display a list of all alarms set by the user.
   - When an alarm goes off, utilize JavaScript's alert function to notify the user in the browser.
